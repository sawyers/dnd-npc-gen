Barbarians are generally led by strong charismatic warriors, but much of the people are governed by extended family groupings such as clans. Like the Nomads, most adult males are warriors in addition to any other profession that they follow (although, like the Vikings, they may put this skill to work pillaging as opposed to warring). They may live in small cities, which are often not much more than semipermanent camps. Examples of historical Barbarian cultures include: feudal Europe (period of Charlemagne), Gauls, Vikings, pre-19th century Iroquois and Cherokee Indian tribes. Fictional Barbarians include J. R. R.
